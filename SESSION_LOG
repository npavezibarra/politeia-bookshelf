Sessions:

December 31st, 11:43 UTC
1. Created SESSION_LOG to begin tracking plugin work sessions.
2. Documented initial log structure for future updates.

December 31st, 2025, 14:09 UTC
1. Added AGENTS.md to plugin root with master goal and Phase 0 ground rules.
2. Identified canonical write entry points for books/authors/pivot tables (single-add and confirm flows).
3. Added a canonical write guard: single-add uses source='candidate' (no inserts), confirm flow uses source='confirmed' (allowed).

December 31st, 2025, 15:03 UTC
1. Added prs_create_book_candidate to create suggestion-only candidates and optionally enqueue them.
2. Normalized candidate ingestion and stored original input + external metadata + raw payloads in queue rows.
3. Refactored single-add flow to use candidate creation + immediate confirmation, and added a pre-check to link existing canonical books before queuing.
