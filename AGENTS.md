Scope: /Users/nicolaspavez/Local Sites/nupoliteia/app/public

Master Goal

Canonical truth (wp_politeia_books, authors, pivots) must only be written after an explicit confirmation step.
Single-book and multi-book flows must obey the same authority rules, even if UX differs.

Phase 0 — Ground Rules (tell Codex this first)

Non-negotiables:

Do NOT change table schemas unless explicitly instructed.
Do NOT delete legacy columns yet.
Do NOT refactor UI unless instructed.
Refactor flow first, cleanup later.
All new frontend text must be translatable and added to the appropriate .po/.mo files.
